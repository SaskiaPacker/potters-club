                    These classes will use more simplistic methods to begin with and teach you a some theory, so
                    you understand
                    why things are done, not just how. This is to engage you with the practise of ceramics and hopefully
                    give you a good
                    basis for understanding different methods of ceramics. We will coax out your creativity skills,
                    allowing
                    you to see the
                    progress over the weeks.<strong> Typically students will come to this class for around 12 weeks and
                        then
                        move on
                        to
                        intermediate.</strong>
                </p>

            <div class="class-container">
                <h2 class="class-heading"><em>Intermediate</em></h2>
                <p>
                    This is where we start to introduce you to things like using a wheel, where you can make pretty much
                    anything. We will
                    build upon the skills learned in the beginner course (if you're coming in straight into intermediate
                    class, then that's
                    not a problem at all, as you will already have a good understanding and skills; we can help you
                    build on those). We will
                    aim to make a range of pieces in this class and introduce you to different decorative, experimental
                    methods. This class
                    is all about being experimental and exploring to find what you love.<strong> Students usually come
                        to this class for around 8 weeks.</strong>

                    You will have a great understanding of the practise by this point and will be very confident. Here
                    we really start to
                    refine your skills and allow you to take the reins on your own projects. We'll continue to expand
                    your knowledge on the
                    making and decorating part. In addition, we'll build your knowledge and start to get you to think of
                    yourself as your
                    own artist. We'll show you where you can start to sell your work, if that's something you wish to
                    do, really starting to
                    get you to think of yourself as a brand.<strong> People usually come to this class for around 10
                        weeks.</strong>
