# Potters Club

*I would just like to state that I am dsylexic, so if there is gramatical erros or mistake please bare with me.*

My idea for this project was to create a website for people who wanted to be able to take a pottery class. They can find out about Potters Club, what they do, what classes they run and the audience can also keep in contact by signing up to hear about talks, special classes they might want to attend.

# UX
### Site Purpose
To provide information on pottery studio for people of all levels who to want to learn and improve their craft in a studio space.

### Site Goal
To provide information on the classes the studio runs, a more in-depth detail of what you do in those classes and the techniques you will learn in addition how to book them. 

### Audience
Anybody that wants to learn and has an interest about the pottery. The primary target audience is 18-50.

### Current User Goal
- To get further information on the next-level classes that they can undertake and to get information on how book those in.

### New User Goal
- To learn about the studio and what we do. 
- Find which class is appropreiate for them to start with and how to book that. 
- To sign up so they can keep in contact and hear about special classes that we do, talks and workshops.

## Communication
I wanted to soften the harsh white background and give a connotation of clay, hence using the off cream color for the background. In addition to this, I wanted the typeface to be clear and communicative, this is why I chose a serif typeface for titles and to make the body copy eaier to read, I chose a sans serif typeface.

The information is easy to read and navigate and the images are large enough to view easily on screen.

# Design
### Wireframes
I cerated my wireframes by hand, sketching out the layout and flow of the website and jotting down what content would go where. This allows me to see how the flow fo the website will work and if it's navitgation and asthetic work well together.

![Wireframe three](/assets/images-readme/wireframe-three.jpg)
![Wireframe four](/assets/images-readme/wireframe-four.jpg)

### Colour Pallette
The colour pallette was sourced from coolors.co. I wanted to keep the colour theme very muted, to give the essence of earth-toned and remind the audience they would be working with nautral materials. To make the audience feel relaxed when they opened the webpage and take away the harsh white background, I chose for the off cream to be the background colour and to make sure the typography contrasted against the background, I chose the off grey colour.
![Colour Pallette](/assets/images-readme/colour-palette.png)

### Typography
My typgoraphy was sourced from Google Fonts. I wanted to have a contrasting typefaces so they were easily distinguishable and contrast against one another. All of the titles are Play Fair display ad the body copy is called Source Sans Pro. I checked that they paired well togeher, as they I sourced the pairing from Google Fonts.

### Imagery
All imagery for the website has been sourced from either pexel.com or unsplash.com which are free photo stock platforms. I specifically wanted to show imagery of all the stages of pottery, so the audience can get an understanding of the process.

### Video
The video is sourced from Youtube and is credited in the credits section of this document. I wanted a fun interactive video, that showed the process of making something from clay, to show the audience and hopefully encourage them to sign up to a course using our website. 

# Features
## Existing Features
### Languages  used
- HTML 
- CSS

### Navigation Bar
This is included on all three pages and provides an easy structure for the audience to be able to use. This is a responsive feature and remain this way, until 450px and down where the navigation bar moves under logo, so the design of both of these features isn't compromised. 

![navigation bar](/assets/images-readme/nav-bar-screenshot.png)

### Landing Page
![landing page](/assets/images-readme/landing-page-screenshot.png)

The landing page is displayed above. The image sits flush off the page, to give an incentive for the audience to scroll down. I wanted a compelling sentence next to the image to draw the audience in and make them ingtruigued to explore the web page further. The image spans over 50% of the width as I wanted the image to really draw in the audience's attention. 

### About us
![about us page](/assets/images-readme/about-us-page.png)
The about us section is situated directly below the landing page, with a short introduction paragraph you get a sense of what potters club is about.

Sitatued directly below the about us section, is a small review section, which give the audience an idea of how other people have found the classes, which is designed to encourage the audience to book.

### Video 
![video](/assets/images-readme/video.png)

# Testing
When running my code through the validator the iframe feature didn't like that I originally had a with and height percentage dimension in the iframe tag. To resolve this, I took the percentage dimensions out of the iframe tag and set them in the css styling.

when running through my html through the W3C validator, initially a few things came that I need to close certain tags or take away section symantics, once I had done this, my html passed without any errors. 

When making my website, when going larger that my screen I designed it on, there weren't too many changes I had to make. However, when the screen started getting smaller, that's when I came accross the most challenges. It was mainly in re-sizing of images, the logo, navigation bar and the table size on the classes page. This was rectified with trail and error, however I eventually got there. 

Initially I had the writing next to the hero image as an in-line block with a huge line height. I then fixed this through making the position relative and setting the position percentages. This was a much a more effective way of getitng the desired style that I wanted.

Another issues that was resolved, an error kept on coming up about my imported typefaces from Google Fonts. It was brought to my attention that I had accidentally put a space in front of the link, so this was easily resolved.

### Validator Testing
![w3c html validation image one](/assets/images-readme/w3c-validation-one.png)
![w3c html validation image two](/assets/images-readme/w3c-validation-two.png)
![w3c html validation image three](/assets/images-readme/w3c-validation-three.png)
![w3c html validation image four](/assets/images-readme/w3c-validation-four.png)
- all of my html pages have been put through the w3c html tester and passed.
  
![w3c css validation image one](/assets/images-readme/w3c-css.png)
- all of the css code has been put through w3c tester and has passed.

![lighthouse rating](/assets/images-readme/lighthouse-rating.png)
- my page has excellenc accessibility rating
- Test the opening the site in Google Chrome and Safari and it opens with no issues. 
- All external links open in new tabs and arrive at the desired website. 

### Unfixed Bugs 
When the website is at it's smallest size, the leading of the body copy is slightly too large and the image on the main section sits slightly too small. However, I don't think this takes away from the design too much. I intend to spend more time of this website and be able to fix those buges.
