# Potters Club

*I would just like to state that I am dsylexic, so if there is gramatical erros or mistake please bare with me.*

My idea for this project was to create a website for people who wanted to be able to take a pottery class. They can find out about Potters Club, what they do, what classes they run and the audience can also keep in contact by signing up to hear about talks, special classes they might want to attend.

## UX
### Site Purpose:
To provide information on pottery studio for people of all levels who to want to learn and improve their craft in a studio space.

### Site Goal:
To provide information on the classes the studio runs, a more in-depth detail of what you do in those classes and the techniques you will learn in addition how to book them. 

### Audience:
Anybody that wants to learn and has an interest about the pottery. The primary target audience is 18-50.

### Current User Goal:

- Find which class is appropreiate for them to start with and how to book that. 
- To sign up so they can keep in contact and hear about special classes that we do, talks and workshops.

## Communication:
I wanted to soften the harsh white background and give a connotation of clay, hence using the off cream color for the background. In addition to this, I wanted the typeface to be clear and communicative, this is why I chose a serif typeface for titles and to make the body copy eaier to read, I chose a sans serif typeface.

The information is easy to read and navigate and the images are large enough to view easily on screen.

## Design
### Wireframes:
I cerated my wireframes by hand, sketching out the layout and flow of the website and jotting down what content would go where. This allows me to see how the flow fo the website will work and if it's navitgation and asthetic work well together.

### Colour Pallette:
The colour pallette was sourced from coolors.co. I wanted to keep the colour theme very muted, to give the essence of earth-toned and remind the audience they would be working with nautral materials. To make the audience feel relaxed when they opened the webpage and take away the harsh white background, I chose for the off cream to be the background colour and to make sure the typography contrasted against the background, I chose the off grey colour.

### Typography:
My typgoraphy was sourced from Google Fonts. I wanted to have a contrasting typefaces so they were easily distinguishable and contrast against one another. All of the titles are Play Fair display ad the body copy is called Source Sans Pro. I checked that they paired well togeher, as they I sourced the pairing from Google Fonts.

### Imagery:
All imagery for the website has been sourced from either pexel.com or unsplash.com which are free photo stock platforms. I specifically wanted to show imagery of all the stages of pottery, so the audience can get an understanding of the process.

### Video:
The video is sourced from Youtube and is credited in the credits section of this document. I wanted a fun interactive video, that showed the process of making something from clay, to show the audience and hopefully encourage them to sign up to a course using our website. 

# Features
## Existing Features
### Languages  used:
- HTML 
- CSS

### Navigation Bar:
This is included on all three pages and provides an easy structure for the audience to be able to use. This is a responsive feature and remain this way, until 450px and down where the navigation bar moves under logo, so the design of both of these features isn't compromised.
