# Potters Club

*I would just like to state that I am dsylexic, so if there is gramatical erros or mistake please bare with me.*

My idea for this project was to create a website for people who wanted to be able to take a pottery class. They can find out about Potters Club, what they do, what classes they run and the audience can also keep in contact by signing up to hear about talks, special classes they might want to attend.
