# Potters Club

*I would just like to state that I am dsylexic, so if there is gramatical erros or mistake please bare with me.*

My idea for this project was to create a website for people who wanted to be able to take a pottery class. They can find out about Potters Club, what they do, what classes they run and the audience can also keep in contact by signing up to hear about talks, special classes they might want to attend.

To learn about the studio and what we do. Also find which class is appropreiate for them to start with and how to book that. Also to sign up so they can keep in contact and hear about special classes that we do, talks and workshops.

## Communication
I wanted to soften the harsh white background and give a connotation of clay, hence using the off cream color for the background. In addition to this, I wanted the typeface to be clear and communicative, this is why I chose a serif typeface for titles and to make the body copy eaier to read, I chose a sans serif typeface.

The information is easy to read and navigate and the images are large enough to view easily on screen.

## Design

### Wireframes
I cerated my wireframes by hand, sketching out the layout and flow of the website and jotting down what content would go where. This allows me to see how the flow fo the website will work and if it's navitgation and asthetic work well together.

### Colour Pallette
The colour pallette was sourced from coolors.co. I wanted to keep the colour theme very muted, to give the essence of earth-toned and remind the audience they would be working with nautral materials. To make the audience feel relaxed when they opened the webpage and take away the harsh white background, I chose for the off cream to be the background colour and to make sure the typography contrasted against the background, I chose the off grey colour.
